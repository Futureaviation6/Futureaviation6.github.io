The probe detects a fading echo: the roar of kerosene engines, once the heartbeat of the skies, is going silent. By 2030, electric and hydrogen aircraft seize major shares of short and regional routes, with markets surging into tens of billions. What emerges in their place? Silent, zero-emission flight as the new standard.

Scanning deeper: the transition unfolds in clear, accelerating phases, turning today’s prototypes into tomorrow’s dominant fleets.

### Three phases of the green sky takeover

1. **Seed Phase (2025–2030): Urban and Short-Haul Go Electric**  
   eVTOL air taxis enter widespread service; 9- to 30-seat electric aircraft gain certification. The electric aviation market expands to USD 37 billion.

2. **Scale-Up (2030–2035): Hydrogen Hybrids Dominate Regional**  
   Airbus and Boeing roll out hydrogen-powered jets capable of 1,000+ mile routes; sustainable aviation fuel blends become mandatory across remaining conventional fleets.

3. **Zero-Emission Era (2035–2040): Full Transition**  
   Hydrogen propulsion takes over medium-haul flights; electric systems rule urban and short routes. Net-zero fleets become the industry standard.

### By 2030 You'll Experience

- Silent air taxis lifting off from rooftop to rooftop.  
- Solar-powered vertiports with rapid charging hubs.  
- Personal eVTOLs becoming accessible to the masses.

### A Morning Flight in 2040

You step outside. A hydrogen-powered craft lifts off in near silence.  
The AI pilot quietly notes real-time energy efficiency gains.  
You glide emission-free across continents and oceans.  
Fuel as we know it? A museum relic.

Key signal: the age of burning kerosene in the atmosphere is over—replaced by clean energy cycles that leave only water vapor behind.

The probe finishes its pass and slips into shadow: the skies have gone green, and the old fuel age feels as distant as steam engines.
